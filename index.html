            <p>My name is Miranda and I am learning to computer programming.
                I am originally from League City, Texas, but currently live in Kennewick, Washington.
                I have been married for almost 22 years and have two teenage sons.
                Something interesting about me is I am a Master Diver and have touched the North American and European Tectonic Plates at the same time while diving.</p>
